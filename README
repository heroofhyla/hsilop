hsilop is a simple reverse polish notation calculator for the terminal, written in c++.

Known issues:
-when using multiplication, the * must be either enclosed in quotes or escaped 
with a backslash, because the terminal replaces * with a list of all matching 
files in the directory.

-the -help parameter is not yet implemented
