hsilop is a simple reverse polish notation calculator for the terminal, written in c++.

Known issues:
-when using multiplication, the * must be either enclosed in quotes or escaped 
with a backslash, because the terminal replaces * with a list of all matching 
files in the directory.

-scientific notation using does not currently work for negative exponents. As a
 workaround, use an input format like:
'5.1 10 -3 ^ \*' instead of '5.1e-3'

-the -help parameter is not yet implemented
